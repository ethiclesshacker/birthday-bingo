Frontend:
    Take User input.
        Name
        List of items
        Start with a background color. Prooooooobably upload a picture later.
    
    Send Button
    
    Get Back created image
    
    Download button for said image


Backend:
    Collect Data from Frontend

    Generate sample HTML file.
        Either use the template thingy for the ss-er
        Or have it as a string with backticks and enter details there.

    Create ss of the file

    Pass that back to the Frontend.
        Probably check how to manage this creation and return from backend to frontend.


Backend Modules:
    Express
    
    node-html-to-image

    And probably a whole bunch of middlewares.
