Frontend:
    Take User input.
        Name
        List of items
        Start with a background color. Prooooooobably upload a picture later.
    
    Send Button
    
    Get Back created image
    
    Download button for said image


Backend:
    Collect Data from Frontend

    Generate sample HTML file.
        Either use the template thingy for the ss-er
            Read template.html file.
            Add for loop handlebars to the template.
            Add CSS as <style> tags in the html itself.

    Create ss of the file -- directly generate base64 and return that in object

    Pass that back to the Frontend.
        Probably check how to manage this creation and return from backend to frontend.
            Create image as base64 and send that via object to frontend in the response.


Backend Modules:
    Express
    
    node-html-to-image

    And probably a whole bunch of middlewares.


Parts Left:
    Add and check styles for the image
